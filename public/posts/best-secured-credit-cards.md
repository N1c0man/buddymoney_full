# Best Secured Credit Cards (Beginner’s Guide)

If you’re rebuilding your credit or starting from scratch, a secured credit card can be the safest and most predictable way to build a strong credit profile. The key is choosing a card that doesn’t bury you in fees and gives you a real upgrade path.

Let’s break down how secured cards work — and which ones are worth your time.

## What Is a Secured Credit Card?

A secured credit card works like a normal credit card, except you provide a refundable security deposit. That deposit becomes your credit limit.

It’s perfect if:

- You’ve never had credit before  
- Your score is below 600  
- You’re recovering from past mistakes  
- You were denied for traditional credit cards  

> **GOOD NEWS:**  
> Used responsibly, a secured card can raise your score in as little as **3–6 months**.

## How Secured Cards Help You Build Credit

Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes:

### ✔ Reports to all 3 credit bureaus  
This is the #1 rule. If it doesn’t report to **Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion**, skip it.

### ✔ Helps build payment history  
Payment history is **35%** of your credit score — the single largest factor.

### ✔ Helps establish credit utilization  
Keeping your balance below **10–30%** helps your score climb steadily.

### ✔ Can upgrade to unsecured  
Many banks review your account after a few months and give you:

- Your deposit back  
- A higher limit  
- A “real” unsecured card

### ✔ Step 2: Pay ON TIME — always  
Even one late payment can set you back for months.

This avoids interest and keeps utilization low.
