# Secured vs Unsecured Credit Cards: Which Is Better for Rebuilding Credit?

If you’re trying to rebuild your credit, choosing the wrong type of credit card can slow you down — or make things worse.

The short answer:  
👉 **Most people rebuilding credit should start with a secured credit card.**  
But there are cases where an unsecured card makes sense.

Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## The Quick Answer (TL;DR)

- **Bad credit or no credit?** → Secured credit card  
- **Fair credit (600–670)?** → Possibly unsecured starter card  
- **Denied for cards before?** → Secured card wins  

👉 If approval and predictability matter, start with one of the  
**[best secured credit cards for rebuilding credit](/blog/best-secured-credit-cards)**.

## What Is a Secured Credit Card?

A secured credit card requires a **refundable security deposit**, which usually becomes your credit limit.

Key traits:
- Easier approval  
- Lower risk for the bank  
- Reports to credit bureaus  
- Designed for rebuilding or starting credit  

Secured cards are one of the safest ways to build credit from the ground up.

👉 See top options in our guide to  
**[secured credit cards for rebuilding credit](/blog/best-secured-credit-cards)**.

## What Is an Unsecured Credit Card?

An unsecured credit card does **not** require a deposit. Approval is based on your credit profile.

Key traits:
- No upfront deposit  
- Higher approval standards  
- Higher risk for lenders  
- Often higher fees for low-credit applicants  

Unsecured cards are better suited for people with **established or improving credit**.

## Which Credit Card Is Better for Rebuilding Credit?

### If You Have No Credit History
A secured card is usually the fastest and safest option.

### If You Have Bad Credit (Below ~600)
Secured cards give you approval odds and structure that unsecured cards won’t.

### If You Have Fair Credit (600–670)
You *might* qualify for an unsecured starter card, but fees and limits can be worse than secured options.

## Can You Upgrade From Secured to Unsecured?

Yes — many secured cards review your account after **6–12 months**.

If you’ve:
- Paid on time  
- Kept balances low  
- Avoided new negatives  

You may receive:
- Your deposit back  
- A higher credit limit  
- An unsecured card offer  

This is why secured cards are often the **first step**, not the final one.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Closing your secured card too early  
- Maxing out your credit limit  
- Missing even one payment  
- Applying for multiple cards at once  

Credit rebuilding rewards consistency, not speed.
