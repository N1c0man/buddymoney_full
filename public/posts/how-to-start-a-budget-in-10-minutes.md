# How to Start a Budget in 10 Minutes

**Budgeting doesn’t have to be complicated or time-consuming.**  
In fact, you can create a simple, powerful plan in just ten minutes.  
Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up a budget that actually works—even if you’ve never tracked a dollar before.

## 1. Grab Your Numbers (2 minutes)
Before you can tell your money where to go, you need to know where it’s been.  
Spend the first two minutes gathering these:

* **Monthly income:** Your paycheck after taxes, plus any side hustle or freelance income.  
* **Essential bills:** Rent or mortgage, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments.  
* **Flexible spending:** Groceries, gas, entertainment.

Tip: Log in to your bank app and skim the last month of statements. No need to be perfect—an estimate is fine to start.

## 2. Pick a Budgeting Method (1 minute)
There’s no one-size-fits-all, but beginners do well with one of these:

* **50/30/20 rule** – 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings and debt payoff.  
* **Zero-based budget** – Every dollar has a job: income minus expenses equals zero.  
* **Pay-yourself-first** – Move savings or debt payments off the top, spend what’s left.

Choose whichever feels simplest—you can always tweak later.

## 3. Create Three Buckets (3 minutes)
Open a spreadsheet, a free budgeting app, or even a notepad and make three sections:

* **Needs:** Housing, food, transportation, insurance, minimum debt payments.  
* **Wants:** Dining out, streaming services, hobbies.  
* **Savings/Debt Payoff:** Emergency fund, retirement contributions, extra loan payments.

Add your numbers quickly. Round to the nearest \$10 if that saves time.

## 4. Spot the Gaps (2 minutes)
Now, compare your totals:

* Are **needs** more than 50% of income? Look for one bill to lower (cheaper cell plan, renegotiated insurance).  
* Are **wants** crowding out savings? Pick one expense to trim for next month.  
* Savings too small? Automate a transfer—even \$20 a week builds momentum.

Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection.

## 5. Automate & Review (2 minutes)
Set up these simple habits so your budget runs itself:

* **Automatic transfers** to savings the day you’re paid.  
* **Automatic bill pay** for fixed expenses.  
* **Monthly 10-minute check-in** to adjust numbers and track progress.

Automation prevents “oops, I forgot to save” moments.

## Quick Tips for Success
* **Start small:** Even a \$5 weekly transfer builds the habit.  
* **Use cash or a debit card** for wants to stay aware of spending.  
* **Celebrate wins:** Paid off a credit card? Treat yourself—within budget.

## Why This Works
This 10-minute approach lowers the biggest barrier to budgeting—**time and complexity.**  
It gives you a clear picture of your finances and a flexible framework that you can refine each month.

* After your first month, review where your estimates were off and adjust.
