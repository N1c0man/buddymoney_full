# How Much Salary Should You Be Making for Your Age in 2025?

> INFO: Knowing whether you're “on track” financially isn’t about comparing yourself to others — it’s about understanding national averages, market value, and what you can do to grow.

It’s one of the most common questions people ask:  
**“How much money should I be making for my age?”**

The truth is, salaries vary based on career, education, industry, and location — but national data can still give you a solid benchmark to understand where you stand and how to improve.

Below is a clear, updated breakdown of **median salary by age for 2025**, plus tips for negotiating a raise and tools to help you maximize your income.

## Median Salary by Age in the U.S. (2025)

These numbers are based on national data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (rounded to the nearest thousand):

### Age 16–19  
**Median Salary:** ~$30,000  
Most earnings here come from part-time work, entry-level jobs, or early internships.

### Age 20–24  
**Median Salary:** ~$36,000  
This includes early career roles, retail, service work, and entry-level office positions.

### Age 25–34  
**Median Salary:** ~$52,000  
This age group has the biggest salary jumps due to skill-building and career changes.

### Age 35–44  
**Median Salary:** ~$62,000  
Often peak growth years — management roles, raises, and specialization.

### Age 45–54  
**Median Salary:** ~$64,000  
Salaries plateau slightly but remain strong; experience drives value.

### Age 55–64  
**Median Salary:** ~$62,000  
Often steady or slightly declining as workers change careers, reduce hours, or prepare for retirement.

### Age 65+  
**Median Salary:** ~$46,000  
Many work part-time or transition to consulting or flexible work.

## What These Numbers Actually Mean

Before you compare yourself, remember:

- These are **national medians**, not “shoulds.”  
- Your city can raise or lower expectations dramatically.  
- Skills, certifications, and industry matter *even more* than age.  
- Many people are underpaid and don’t realize it — until they negotiate.

> NOTE: Being below the median doesn’t mean you’re doing poorly. It means you’re early in your skill-building or in a lower-paying industry, which is completely normal.

---

## Are You Underpaid for Your Age?

Here are signs you might be earning less than your market value:

- You haven’t received a meaningful raise in 18–24 months  
- You’re doing more work than your job description  
- You trained or help new employees  
- You see job postings offering more than you’re paid  
- You haven’t negotiated in years  

If 2 or more apply, you may be underpaid — and it’s fixable.

## How to Increase Your Salary in 2025

### 1. Ask for a Raise (With the Right Script)
You're not “begging” — you're presenting your value.

Here’s a simple raise script:

> “I’ve taken on additional responsibilities including _______. Based on my performance and today’s market rate for this role, I’d like to discuss an adjustment to my compensation.”

Confidence + data beats fear every time.

---

### 2. Apply for New Jobs Every 6–12 Months  
Most salary growth happens when you **change companies**, not inside them.

A 10–20% jump is common when switching roles.

---

### 3. Learn One Monetizable Skill  
High-growth skills in 2025 include:
- Copywriting  
- Project management  
- Data analysis  
- UX/UI design  
- Sales  
- Basic coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

These can raise your earning potential *dramatically* in 3–12 months.

---

### 4. Start a Side Hustle  
Increasing income doesn’t have to rely on your 9-to-5.

Popular options include:
- Rideshare  
- Freelancing  
- Digital product creation  
- Pet sitting  
- eBay reselling  

Extra income makes raises less stressful — you’re not desperate.
