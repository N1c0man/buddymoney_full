## What These Numbers Actually Mean

Before you compare yourself, remember:

- These are **national medians**, not “shoulds.”  
- Your city can raise or lower expectations dramatically.  
- Skills, certifications, and industry matter *even more* than age.  
- Many people are underpaid and don’t realize it — until they negotiate.

> NOTE: Being below the median doesn’t mean you’re doing poorly. It means you’re early in your skill-building or in a lower-paying industry, which is completely normal.

## Are You Underpaid for Your Age?

Here are signs you might be earning less than your market value:

- You haven’t received a meaningful raise in 18–24 months  
- You’re doing more work than your job description  
- You trained or help new employees  
- You see job postings offering more than you’re paid  
- You haven’t negotiated in years  

If 2 or more apply, you may be underpaid — and it’s fixable.

## How to Increase Your Salary in 2025

### 1. Ask for a Raise (With the Right Script)
You're not “begging” — you're presenting your value.

Here’s a simple raise script:

> “I’ve taken on additional responsibilities including _______. Based on my performance and today’s market rate for this role, I’d like to discuss an adjustment to my compensation.”

Confidence + data beats fear every time.

### 2. Apply for New Jobs Every 6–12 Months  
Most salary growth happens when you **change companies**, not inside them.

A 10–20% jump is common when switching roles.

---

### 3. Learn One Monetizable Skill  
High-growth skills in 2025 include:
- Copywriting  
- Project management  
- Data analysis  
- UX/UI design  
- Sales  
- Basic coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

These can raise your earning potential *dramatically* in 3–12 months.

---

### 4. Start a Side Hustle  
Increasing income doesn’t have to rely on your 9-to-5.

Popular options include:
- Rideshare  
- Freelancing  
- Digital product creation  
- Pet sitting  
- eBay reselling  

Extra income makes raises less stressful — you’re not desperate.
