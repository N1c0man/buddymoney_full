# Crush Credit Card Debt

Credit card debt feels heavy. The interest is high, the balances never seem to move, and minimum payments barely make a dent.

But here’s the truth:


**Debt becomes manageable the moment you give it a system.**

Below is a clear, step-by-step plan used by thousands of people to take control, stay motivated, and wipe out high-interest debt for good.

## 1. List Every Card (You Need the Full Picture)

You can’t fix what you can’t see.  
Make a simple list with:

- **Card name**
- **Balance**
- **APR (interest rate)**
- **Minimum payment**
- **Due date**

A notebook works, or if you want to be precise, use a spreadsheet or the BuddyMoney debt planner (coming soon).

This step alone reduces stress — your brain no longer has to “track everything” silently.

## 2. Pick a Payoff Strategy: Avalanche or Snowball

There are two proven methods:

### **Debt Avalanche (fastest + lowest interest)**
- Pay extra toward the **highest APR** first  
- Saves the most money  
- Typically the fastest method  

### **Debt Snowball (most motivating)**
- Pay extra toward the **smallest balance** first  
- Quick wins help you stay consistent  
- Perfect if you’ve struggled sticking to a plan before  

Pick the method that keeps you moving — both work.

## 3. Find Your “Extra Payment” Number

Even small amounts work:

- $25 extra per month  
- $50 from cutting one subscription  
- $100 from one weekend side gig  

Every extra dollar goes directly to principal — that’s why balances finally start dropping.

## 4. Automate Your Plan

Set up automatic transfers for:

- **Minimums** on every card  
- **Extra payment** on the Avalanche/Snowball target card  

Automation keeps your system working even on stressful weeks.

## 5. Handle Surprises the Smart Way

When life throws curveballs:

- Pause extra payments temporarily  
- Pay minimums  
- Restart next month  

Consistency > perfection.

## 6. Celebrate Every Win

Debt payoff takes time — but momentum is powerful.

Celebrate when you:

- Pay off a card  
- Drop under a major number ($10k, $5k, etc.)  
- Hit a new lowest interest cost  
- Complete 3 consistent months  

Progress fuels motivation.
