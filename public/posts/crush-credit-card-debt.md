# Crush Credit Card Debt

Credit card debt feels heavy.  
The interest is high, the balances barely move, and minimum payments seem endless.

But here’s the truth:

**Debt becomes manageable the moment you give it a system.**

Below is a clear, step-by-step plan to take control, stay motivated, and eliminate high-interest credit card debt for good.

---

## 1. List Every Card (You Need the Full Picture)

You can’t fix what you can’t see.

Start by listing every credit card you have, including:

- **Card name**
- **Current balance**
- **APR (interest rate)**
- **Minimum payment**
- **Due date**

A notebook works just fine, though a spreadsheet or tool can help with accuracy.

This step alone reduces stress — your brain no longer has to silently track everything.

## 2. Pick a Payoff Strategy: Avalanche or Snowball

There are two proven debt payoff methods. Both work — the best one is the one you’ll stick with.

### **Debt Avalanche (fastest and cheapest)**
- Pay extra toward the **highest interest rate** first  
- Saves the most money in interest  
- Usually pays debt off fastest  

### **Debt Snowball (most motivating)**
- Pay extra toward the **smallest balance** first  
- Quick wins build momentum  
- Ideal if motivation has been an issue  

Choose the method that keeps you consistent, not the one that sounds best on paper.

### ⚠️ Avoid This Common Mistake While Paying Off Debt

A common mistake is opening a new credit card too early.

If you’re actively paying down balances or rebuilding after credit card debt, the *type* of card matters more than the brand. In many cases, a **secured credit card** is safer than an unsecured one while your credit score is recovering.

If you’re unsure which option fits your situation, see our breakdown of  
**[secured vs unsecured credit cards](/blog/secured-vs-unsecured-credit-cards)** before applying.

## 3. Find Your “Extra Payment” Number

You don’t need huge amounts to make progress.

Examples:
- $25 extra per month  
- $50 from canceling one subscription  
- $100 from a single weekend side hustle  

Every extra dollar goes directly toward **principal**, which is why balances finally start dropping.

## 4. Automate Your Plan

Automation removes willpower from the process.

Set up automatic payments for:
- **Minimum payments** on every card  
- **One extra payment** toward your avalanche or snowball target  

Once automated, your plan keeps running even during stressful weeks.

---

## 5. Handle Surprises the Smart Way

Life will happen — and that’s okay.

When surprises hit:
- Pause extra payments if needed  
- Continue paying minimums  
- Resume your plan the following month  

Consistency over time matters more than a perfect streak.

---

## 6. Celebrate Every Win

Debt payoff is a long game — momentum matters.

Celebrate when you:
- Pay off a card  
- Drop below a major milestone ($10k, $5k, etc.)  
- Notice interest charges shrinking  
- Complete three consistent months of progress  

Acknowledging progress keeps motivation alive.

## Final Encouragement

Paying off credit card debt is step one.  
Rebuilding smart credit afterward is what keeps it from coming back.

You *can* break free from high-interest credit card debt.

You don’t need perfection — just a simple system and steady effort.

BuddyMoney is here to help you every step of the way.
